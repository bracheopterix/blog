    // TS MAKE IT ALL TS!    
    
    
    
    Designwise
    
    // maybe, it is a good idea to have styles in the obj to just make pool = obj.key 
    // so no need to add to switch every time, just add that short-cut in check-style
    // anyway, keys in obj are already in strings AND we have stylePool (but it is an array->
    // so rewrite auto-generation of dropdown style selection to be able to eat that)

    // also, add to the sushi style more things
    // also, make two icons near the game name to show what style is on
    // and change table background and all colours. And Font Styles!!!
    // make them like in obj? or to chose from?

    // also, make tic-tac-toe
    // also, make chimp-race


    /// MAYBE JUST MAKE ANOTHER CSS MODULE AND CHANGE THE PATH AND SAVE ALL NAMES ???!!!

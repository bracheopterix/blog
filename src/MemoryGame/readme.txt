    Skillwise

    // TS MAKE IT ALL TS!    
    
    // make function of a random take from the pool, ad it to the game start
    // then make a manual choosing how many cards do you want (only x2), maybe make it like volume choosing?
    // make an option to use every tile from every pool together
    
    Designwise
    
    // maybe, it is a good idea to have styles in the obj to just make pool = obj.key 
    // so no need to add to switch every time, just add that short-cut in check-style
    // anyway, keys in obj are already in strings AND we have stylePool (but it is an array->
    // so rewrite auto-generation of dropdown style selection to be able to eat that)

    // also, add to the sushi style more things
    // also, make two icons near the game name to show what style is on
    // and change table background and all colours. And Font Styles!!!
    // make them like in obj? or to chose from?

    // also, make tic-tac-toe
    // also, make chimp-race
